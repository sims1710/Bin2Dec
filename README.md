# Bin2Dec
Description

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

There are 2 files:

1. #Bin2Dec Project.py
2. #Bin2Dec with GUI.py

Installation

Environment with python will required for the code execution. Current version of python tested is version 3.10. Click on the link below to download Python:
[Installation of python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For the python libraries, Bin2Dec is developed with Python Standard Libraries. Python Standard Libraries usually comes together with Python installation, thus no extra steps will be required. (If there is error with missing libraries, you can try pip install the missing libraries.)

Usage

To run the code on terminal (without any GUI), execute #Bin2Dec Project.py. It will run the program. Else run #Bin2Dec with GUI.py.

To edit any parts of the program, the codes are  located in those 2 files.

You can use Python IDLE to run any of the files, or any IDE of your choice that supports Python.

Support

You could just call 911 should you run into errors because the developer is busy with life.

Just kidding, please contact me if you have any queries.

Roadmap

Even though the game is developed, there is room for improvement. Expanding the app to a web application/ mobile application or even to convert to hexadecimal or venturing choosing to convert denary into binary are possible ideas to explore.

Special thanks to:

Project Status

Currently, the project is completed.
